# Cruzsafe-Revamped
A reconstruction of the Cruzsafe project aimed to implement a microservice format &amp; to fix core errors &amp; bugs

Purpose:
  Cruzsafe is a maintenance reporting suite that allows the University of California - Santa Cruz Affiliates to be able to report non-criminal maintenance issues to the appropriate staff. This Suite consists of two (2) apps; a cross-platform mobile app used by the reporting party, and a web app used by the various on-site maintenance facilities to recieve and review the reports.

Main Goals:
1. Rebuild both the web app and the mobile app from the ground up in order to correct any design flaws.
2. Break down the web application into a Microservice Architecture to improve performance.
3. Learn about the design and implementation process of Microservice Architecture.
